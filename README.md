# ThriveCoin Assigment
We would like you to build a React Application which implements a sign-in flow for the users and a restricted dashboard page which only can be accessed after successful authentication.

As a use case, we have chosen sending and receiving Linkedin invitations. :-P

In this [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/kAko373CJ0EybtmIz8GPWT/Front-End-Engineer-Challenge?node-id=106%3A100) you will find the two screens that you should build. The screens are annotated with interaction notes on what functionality needs to be implemented and what functionality you can skip.

Think through your solution and implement it based on the instructions and your own thoughts. Spend **at most** 8 hours on the assignment.

Please note: The contents of this assignment are private. Sharing it will result in your disqualification.

## API Docs

We have prepared an api for the purpose of this assignment. The exported postman collection of the available requests can be found under `postman_collection/request_collection.json`. 

You can as well read the documented API endpoints with examples in [this link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3924575/UVXgNdF1#7cc6a793-a16d-4c1c-83ab-79d25d445a3b)

The API is publicly available in the domain https://thc-ui-api.thrivecoin.com

## A few notes about the assignment
* Do not use the comment or share functionality in the Figma design file; instead email rilind@thrivecoin.com if you have any questions or needs
* Use any desired CSS framework for styling purposes
* The authentication token has an expiration date
* Use Redux or something similar for state management
* Use version control (Git preferably) and commit frequently
* We would love to see tested code

## Follow-up

Share the code with rilind@thrivecoin.com when you are done, preferably via a public GitHub repo. If you decide to deploy your code you are welcome to include a link to the published application.

We will review your solution in a follow-up interview where we will go through and discuss the different aspects of the application. For example:
 * Application structure, used libraries, code, etc.
 * Implementation design choices and their advantages and disadvantages
