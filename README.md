# ThriveCoin Assigment
We would like you to build a React Application which implements a sign in flow for the users and an restricted dashboard page which only can be accessed after successful authentication.

As a use case we have chosen linkedin invitations :P

In this [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/kAko373CJ0EybtmIz8GPWT/Front-End-Engineer-Challenge?node-id=106%3A100) you will find the two screens with interaction notes on what functionalities need to be implemented alongside with notes in the static elements.

Think through your solution and implement it based on the instructions and
your own thoughts. Spend at _most 8 hours_ on the assignment.

## API Docs

We have prepared an api for the purpose of this assigment. The exported postman collection of the available requests can be found under `postman_collection/request_collection.json`. 

You can as well read the documented API endpoints with examples in https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3924575/UVXgNdF1#7cc6a793-a16d-4c1c-83ab-79d25d445a3b

The API is publicly available in the domain https://thc-ui-api.thrivecoin.com

## A few notes about the assignment
* Use any desired CSS framework for styling purposes
* Authentication token has an expiration date
* Use Redux or something similar for state management
* Use version control (Git preferably) and commit frequently
* We would love to see tested code

## Follow-up

Share the code with **rilind@thrivecoin.com** when you are done, preferably via a public
GitHub repo. If you decide to deploy your code you are welcome
to include a link to the published application.

We will review your solution in a follow-up interview where we will go through
and discuss the different aspects of the application, for example:

 * Application structure, used libraries, code, etc.
 * Design choices and their advantages and disadvantages.
